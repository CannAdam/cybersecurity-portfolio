👋 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional whose interest in the field began through hands-on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) work during my time supporting cyber operations. Working with intelligence collection sparked a deeper curiosity about how systems are attacked, defended, and exploited. That foundation in OSINT ultimately pushed me toward a broader focus on cybersecurity—particularly threat analysis, incident response support, and technical problem-solving.

🛡️ CTF Experience

I recently competed in the SANS National Cyber Skyline Capture the Flag (CTF), a multi-stage national cybersecurity competition. The event challenged me to step outside familiar OSINT workflows and strengthen technical skills across network analysis, cryptography, exploitation, and digital forensics. It reinforced how valuable hands-on problem-solving is for staying sharp in a rapidly evolving field.

⭐ Highlights

Ranked 85th out of 454 teams (top 20% nationally).

Successfully solved challenges spanning DNS enumeration, forensic analysis, and crypto puzzles under time pressure.

Collaborated with a multi-disciplinary team to break down complex problems, optimize workflows, and maintain competitive performance across all challenge stages.
